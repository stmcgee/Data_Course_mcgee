# A ggplot is made up of two main components – a ggplot() object and at least one geom layer.
ggplot() + geom_.....


# The ggplot() object acts as a storage facility for the data. 
# It is here where we define the data frame that houses the x and y coordinate values 
# themselves and instructions on how to split the data. 

# Aesthetics
#
    # The aes() aesthetic mapping function lives inside a ggplot object and is where we specify 
    # the set of plot attributes that remain constant throughout the subsequent layers 
    # (unless overwritten – more on this later).
    
    # We can consider the relationship between the aes() and geoms components as follows:
      
    # The aes() function is the “how” – how data is stored, how data is split
    # geoms are the “what”—what the data looks like. These are geometrical objects stored in subsequent layers.

# Layers
# 
# We use the + operator to construct new layers. By appending layers we can connect the “how” (aesthetics) 
# to the “what” (geometric objects). Adding geometric, scale, facet and statistic layers to a ggplot() 
# object is how to control virtually every visual aspect of the plot from the data contained in the object.

    # Adding a geometric object layer
    #   
    # A geometric object is used to define the style of the plot. Common geometric objects include:
    #   
    # geom_point() which is used to draw a dot plot
    # geom_line() used to draw a line plot
    # geom_bar() used to draw a bar chart.
    # 
    # 
    # A single plot can have numerous geom layers, and it is also possible to overlay results 
    # from multiple data frames in one plot. Overwriting the aesthetic mapping that was 
    # defined in the ggplot() object can be done inside a geom object function (more on this later!).
